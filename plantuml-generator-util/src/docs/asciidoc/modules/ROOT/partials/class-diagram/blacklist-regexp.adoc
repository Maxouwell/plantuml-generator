include::./_attributes.adoc[]

= Description
// tag::description[]
This parameter can only be specified together with a list of packages
to scan for. 
This is because otherwise the number of classes would otherwise be to
large.
So the decision was made to combine both of them as constructor parameter
to the {builderclass}.

If this parameter is specified it is used as a filter for all classes found
in the 
xref:./scanpackages.adoc[defined packages to scan] 
and used via the String.matches method of
Java.
// end::description[]

= Default value
// tag::defaultvalue[]
There is no default value for the blacklist regular expression.
It is only used when specified and not empty.
// end::defaultvalue[]
