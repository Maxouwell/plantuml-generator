== Example
In the following example there are three dependencies in the maven 
dependency hierarchy which build the classpath for all further generation:

[source,xml]
----
include::example$itresources/classdiagram/0024-use-short-classnames-in-fields-and-methods-it/pom.xml[tags=dependencies]
----

From this classpath all classes of the package "de.elnarion.test.domain.t0025",
which are also used by the 
xref:plantuml-generator-util:ROOT:class-diagram/config/use-short-classnames-in-fields-and-methods.adoc[JUnit-tests of the PlantUML generator utility],
should be generated as class diagram with the following plugin configuration:

[source,xml]
----
include::example$itresources/classdiagram/0024-use-short-classnames-in-fields-and-methods-it/pom.xml[tags=mvn]
----

but class names in fields and methods (parameters or return values) should be
shortened (no package name). 
This configuration leads to this diagram:

[plantuml,0024_use_short_classnames_in_fields_and_methods_diagram,png]
----
include::plantuml-generator-util:ROOT:example$testresources/class/0025_use_short_classnames_in_fields_and_methods.txt[]
----

and produces this PlantUML diagram text:

[source,plantuml,indent=0]
----
include::plantuml-generator-util:ROOT:example$testresources/class/0025_use_short_classnames_in_fields_and_methods.txt[]
